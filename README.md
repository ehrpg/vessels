# Intro
This project covers a javascript application that supports players and DMs playing *Endless Horzions* by providing a way to lookup, 
create and customize vessels.
The source code is designed to work in every modern browser without any special requirements such as a webserver. This is why the data objects are defined in a .js file rather than in JSON, YAML or whatever. (See Chrome CORS)
